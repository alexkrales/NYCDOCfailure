	<p> In 2022 Rikers Island has seen 18 people die and 412 stabbed. Many city, state and local officials agree that Rikers must be closed. Alternatively advocates for Receivership state that this would enable sweeping changes such as firing of chronically absent correctional officers.</p>

	<p> Local Mott Haven, Bronx Resident Alexander Hall who was formerly incarcerated does not think Federal Receivership will solve the issues in New York’s local jail, “Rikers Island is not the whole problem. Rikers Island is just a place. The culture is the problem, the culture of abuse, the whole system there that's the problem, you can bring whomever you want into that system. The feds are no better.” Rikers Island has been under federal Monitor for over five years documenting the daily increase in violence, deaths, and Staff Absenteeism. </p>

<p> Officers on Rikers Island are represented by the Correctional officers Union one of the strongest in the country has many benefits including unlimited sick time. In 2021 the Correctional officers union settled out of Court after being sued by the City of New York stating officer absenteeism amounted to an illegal strike. </p>

<p> Thursday three New York City Correctional officers were charged with federal program fraud in Brooklyn federal court. It is unclear if there are more charges to come. Rikers island is currently under a federal monitor and the question of federal receivership that would put the Jail under the control of a federal court is ongoing.</p>

	<p> In a the preliminary statement heard by the Supreme Court, the City of New York vs. Correction Officers Benevolent Association, Attorney Georgia M. Prestana for the Corporation Council of the City of New York sought to “restrain the defendant from causing, encouraging, or condoning a strike or other concerted action or slow down.” This case was settled out of Court in 2021. </p>

<p>Darren Mack spokesperson for Freedom Agenda, an organization involved with planning the closure of the Jail was formerly incarcerated on Rikers Island stated “the problem is there's this chronic absenteeism, which if you were to ask me, appears more to be like a worker's strike, but, you know, city workers can't strike, that's exacerbating the crisis.” Mack urged the Mayor and city government to review the Community Reinvestment Report outlining how public funds could be reallocated.</p>

<p> Founder of Vital City Liz Glazer said their data shows the numbers of fights, slashing, stabbings at Rikers attributing to the jail’s deterioration during COVID. She said understaffing exacerbates Riker’s inhumane conditions. Former Rikers Chief Investigator Serena Townsend said at Rikers Island today 85% of detainees have not been charged yet 70% miss their court date due to understaffing. Staff absenteeism is over 12% and stabbings have increased by 30%. </p>
