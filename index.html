	<p> This year saw 18 people die and 412 stabbed on Rikers Island. Many city, state and local officials have advocated for the prison to be closed, while others argue that a federal receivership would enable sweeping changes to the prison’s administration.</p>

	<p>A federal receivership would put the prison under new management, says attorney Hernandez Shroud. “Judges typically give receivers wide-ranging authority such as the power to manage staff, make contracts, access government records, conduct confidential interviews, procure goods, and set budgets.”</p>

<p>Officers on Rikers Island are represented by the Correctional Officers Union, and have many benefits including unlimited sick time. In 2021 the city government sued the union for supporting absenteeism by Rikers officers. In the preliminary statement heard by the Supreme Court, the city’s legal team sought to “restrain the defendant from causing, encouraging, or condoning a strike or other concerted action or slowdown.” This case was settled out of Court in 2021</p>

<p>Darren Mack spokesperson for Freedom Agenda, an organization involved with planning the closure of the Jail that was formerly incarcerated on Rikers Island stated “The problem is there's this chronic absenteeism, which if you were to ask me, appears more to be like a worker's strike,” said Darren Mack, a spokesperson for Freedom Agenda.</p>

	<p>“City workers can't strike, that's exacerbating the crisis,” Mack added, urging the Mayor and city government to review the Community Reinvestment Report outlining how public funds could be reallocated.</p>

<p>On Thursday three correctional officers were charged with fraud in federal court, and it is unclear if there are more charges to come. The question of federal receivership for Rikers island would put the Jail under a court-appointed expert.</p>

<p>Alexander Hall, a Bronx resident who was incarcerated in Rikers for 16 years, says that federal receivership will not solve the issues in New York’s local jail. “Rikers Island is not the whole problem. Rikers Island is just a place,” Hall said. “The whole system there is the problem, you can bring whoever you want into that system. The feds are no better.” </p>

<p>Rikers Island has been under federal Monitor for over five years documenting the daily increase in violence, deaths, and Staff Absenteeism. Liz Glazer,Founder of Vital City, said their data shows the numbers of fights, slashing, and stabbings at Rikers attributing to the jail’s deterioration during COVID. She said understaffing exacerbates Riker’s inhumane conditions. Former Rikers Chief Investigator Serena Townsend said at Rikers Island today 85% of detainees have not been charged yet 70% miss their court date due to understaffing. Staff absenteeism is over 12% and stabbings have increased by 30%.</p>
