	<p> This year saw 18 people die and 412 stabbed on Rikers Island. Many city, state and local officials have advocated for the prison to be closed, while others argue that a federal receivership would enable sweeping changes to the prison such as firing absent Officers.</p>

<p>Officers on Rikers Island are represented by the Correctional Officers Union, and have many benefits including unlimited sick time. In 2021 the city government sued the union for supporting absenteeism by Rikers officers. In the preliminary statement heard by the Supreme Court, the city’s legal team sought to “restrain the defendant from causing, encouraging, or condoning a strike or other concerted action or slowdown.” This case was settled out of Court in 2021</p>

<p>Darren Mack spokesperson for Freedom Agenda, an organization involved with planning the closure of the Jail that was formerly incarcerated on Rikers Island stated “The problem is there's this chronic absenteeism, which if you were to ask me, appears more to be like a worker's strike,” said Darren Mack, a spokesperson for Freedom Agenda.</p>

	<p>“City workers can't strike, that's exacerbating the crisis,” Mack added, urging the Mayor and city government to review the Community Reinvestment Report outlining how public funds could be reallocated.</p>

<p>On Thursday three correctional officers were charged with fraud in federal court, and it is unclear if there are more charges to come. The question of federal receivership for Rikers island would put the Jail under a court-appointed expert.</p>

<p>Alexander Hall, a Bronx resident who was incarcerated in Rikers for 16 years, says that federal receivership will not solve the issues in New York’s local jail. “Rikers Island is not the whole problem. Rikers Island is just a place,” Hall said. “The whole system there is the problem, you can bring whoever you want into that system. The feds are no better.” </p>
